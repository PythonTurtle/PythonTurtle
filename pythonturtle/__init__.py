An educational environment for learning Python, suitable for beginners
and children. Inspired by LOGO.

PythonTurtle aims to be the most low-threshold way for learning or
teaching Python. The user is given command of an interactive Python
shell, similar to IDLE, and is able to use Python functions to move a
turtle that is displayed on the screen. An illustrated help screen
demonstrates how to move the turtle and introduces the student to the
basics of Python programming.
