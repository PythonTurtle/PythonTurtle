PythonTurtle can load a file with functions already in it.  These functions
will then be available to use in your programs.
Note: The file can contain only functions; it can't contain direct commands
like "go".  It can only contain functions that start with "def".  Other 
items will cause a "syntax error" when loading.

How to load functions from a file:

-Create a file, using a text editor. 

-Add functions to the file; for example:

def polygon(n):
    for i in range(n):
        go(50)
        turn(360.0/n)

def polygon100(n):
    for i in range(n):
        go(100)
        turn(360.0/n)
        
-Save the file with the extension ".ptf"

-From PythonTurtle, select File->Open...

-Select your file and open.
