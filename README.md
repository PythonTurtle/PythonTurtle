An educational environment for learning Python, suitable for beginners and children.
Inspired by LOGO.

An Appealing Environment to Learn Python
----------------------------------------

PythonTurtle strives to provide the lowest-threshold way to learn Python.
Students command an interactive Python shell (similar to the [IDLE development
environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html)) and use Python
functions to move a turtle displayed on the screen.

An illustrated help screen introduces the student to the basics of Python
programming while demonstrating how to move the turtle. Simplicity and a
colorful visual appearance makes the learning environment more appealing
to students.
